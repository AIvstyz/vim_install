Install:

1. install vim. https://blog.csdn.net/zs376957686/article/details/77833953

2. copy (.vimrc .ycm_extra_conf.py .dircolors) to your path ( ~/ )

3. open vim and install plugins: (vim :PluginInstall)

4. install YouCompleteMe: 
cd ~/.vim/bundle/YouCompleteMe
./install.py --clang-completer --go-completer

5. modify the ycm conf ~/.ycm_extra_conf.py to your C++ conf, like this:
flags = [
'-Wall',
'-Wextra',
'-Werror',
'-fexceptions',
'-DNDEBUG',
# THIS IS IMPORTANT! Without a "-std=<something>" flag, clang won't know which
# language to use when compiling headers. So it will guess. Badly. So C++
# headers will be compiled as C headers. You don't want that so ALWAYS specify
# a "-std=<something>".
# For a C project, you would set this to something like 'c99' instead of
# 'c++11'.
'-std=c++1z',
# ...and the same thing goes for the magic -x option which specifies the
# language that the files to be compiled are written in. This is mostly
# relevant for c++ headers.
# For a C project, you would set this to 'c' instead of 'c++'.
